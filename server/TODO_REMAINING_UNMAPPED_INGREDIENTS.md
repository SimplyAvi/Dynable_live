# TODO: Remaining Unmapped Ingredients

## Status as of Phase 1 Completion
- **Total unmapped ingredients remaining**: ~44,147
- **Successfully mapped in Phase 1**: 12,761
- **Mapping rate improvement**: Significant progress made

## What These Unmapped Ingredients Are
These are likely:
1. **Compound foods** (e.g., "6x9-inch sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed")
2. **Specific brand/variety ingredients** (e.g., "GOYAÂ® Whole Jalapeno peppers")
3. **Complex preparation instructions** (e.g., "Anaheim chile peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded")
4. **Measurement-specific ingredients** (e.g., "(16 ounce) containers low-fat vanilla yogurt")
5. **Regional/variety-specific ingredients** (e.g., "Black Mission figs", "Cubanelle peppers")

## Next Steps for Later
1. **Analyze patterns** in the remaining unmapped ingredients
2. **Create new canonical ingredients** for common compound foods
3. **Improve cleaning function** to handle more edge cases
4. **Add fuzzy matching** for similar ingredient names
5. **Consider adding ingredient aliases** for regional/variety names

## Priority for Future Work
- Focus on ingredients that appear frequently across multiple recipes
- Prioritize common cooking ingredients over very specific brand names
- Consider adding canonical ingredients for common compound preparations

## Current System Status
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete (significant improvement achieved)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸ”„ In Progress (subcategory/pure ingredient filtering)
- **Overall mapping coverage**: Much improved, ready for user testing
