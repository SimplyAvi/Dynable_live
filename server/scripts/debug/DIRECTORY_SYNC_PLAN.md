# 🚨 URGENT: Directory Sync Plan

## 🎯 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** We've been working in `/dynable_new/` while SimplyAvi is running from `/dynable_live/`
**Impact:** All our changes, diagnostics, and fixes are targeting the wrong directory

## 🔍 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Identify SimplyAvi's Actual Directory
```bash
# SimplyAvi should run this to find his actual project location:
pwd
ls -la
```

**Expected locations:**
- `/Users/justinlinzan/dynable_live/` (most likely)
- `/Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/` (our current location)
- `/Users/justinlinzan/dynable/` (possible)
- `/Users/justinlinzan/projects/dynable/` (possible)

### Step 2: Determine Project Status
```bash
# SimplyAvi should check if this is the right project:
ls -la
cat package.json | grep name
```

**Look for:**
- `package.json` with React app
- `server/` directory
- `src/` directory with React components
- Running processes on ports 3000 and 5001

### Step 3: Sync Our Changes
Once we identify the correct directory, we need to:

**Option A: Copy our working changes to SimplyAvi's directory**
```bash
# From our current location (/dynable_new/)
cp -r scripts/debug/ /path/to/simplyavi/actual/directory/server/
cp -r database/migrations/ /path/to/simplyavi/actual/directory/server/
# Copy any other working files
```

**Option B: SimplyAvi switches to our directory**
```bash
# SimplyAvi changes to our working directory
cd /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/
```

## 🚀 UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIMPLYAVI

### Quick Directory Check
```bash
# Step 1: Find your actual project
pwd
ls -la

# Step 2: Check if this is the right project
cat package.json | grep name
ls server/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No server directory found"

# Step 3: Tell us the results
```

### If SimplyAvi is in `/dynable_live/`:
```bash
# We need to copy our working files to his directory
# OR have him switch to our directory
```

## 📋 UPDATED DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS

**Current (wrong):**
```bash
cd /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/server
node scripts/debug/run_comprehensive_diagnostics.js
```

**Updated (need SimplyAvi's actual path):**
```bash
cd /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_live/server  # OR actual path
node scripts/debug/run_comprehensive_diagnostics.js
```

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS FOR SIMPLYAVI

1. **What directory are you actually running the app from?**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

2. **Is this the right project?**
   ```bash
   ls -la
   cat package.json | grep name
   ```

3. **Are you running the backend and frontend?**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(node|npm)" | grep -v grep
   ```

4. **What ports are you using?**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :5001
   ```

## 🔧 SYNC STRATEGY

### Option 1: Copy Our Working Code to SimplyAvi's Directory
```bash
# From our location, copy working files to SimplyAvi's directory
cp -r scripts/debug/ /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_live/server/
cp -r database/migrations/ /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_live/server/
```

### Option 2: SimplyAvi Switches to Our Directory
```bash
# SimplyAvi changes to our working directory
cd /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/
```

### Option 3: Identify Which Directory Has the Latest Code
```bash
# Compare both directories
diff -r /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/ /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_live/
```

## 🚨 URGENT NEXT STEPS

1. **SimplyAvi runs the directory check commands above**
2. **We identify the correct project location**
3. **We sync our working changes to the correct directory**
4. **We update all diagnostic commands with correct paths**
5. **We run diagnostics on the actual running application**

This explains why nothing has been working! We need to get on the same page about which directory contains the actual running application.
