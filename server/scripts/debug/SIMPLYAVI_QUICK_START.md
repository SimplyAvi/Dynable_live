# SimplyAvi's Quick Diagnostic Guide

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Open Terminal
- Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
- Type "Terminal" and press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```bash
cd /Users/justinlinzan/dynable_new/server
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Diagnostic
```bash
node scripts/debug/run_comprehensive_diagnostics.js
```

### Step 4: Copy Results
- Select all the output text (Cmd + A)

## 📋 WHAT TO EXPECT

The diagnostic will run for about 2-3 minutes and show:
- ✅ Green checkmarks for working components
- ❌ Red X marks for problems
- 🔍 Detailed error messages
- 💡 Specific solutions

## 🎯 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

The diagnostic will tell us exactly:
1. Is your backend server running?
2. Are your environment variables set up correctly?
3. Can you connect to the database?
4. Are all API endpoints working?
5. What specific errors are happening?

## 📞 IF YOU GET ERRORS

If you see any error messages, don't worry! Just copy them exactly as they appear. The diagnostic is designed to catch and report problems - that's what we want.

## 🔄 AFTER RUNNING

Once you've copied the results, Justin and I will:
1. Analyze the diagnostic output
2. Identify the exact problem
3. Provide you with the exact commands to fix it
4. Verify the fix worked

## 💡 TIP

The diagnostic is safe - it only reads your configuration and tests connections. It won't change anything on your system.
