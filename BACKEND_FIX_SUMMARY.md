# 🔧 Backend & Frontend Issue Resolution

## ✅ **Problems Identified and Fixed**

### **Backend Issue:**
The backend server couldn't start because essential files were missing from the `server/` directory:
- `package.json` - Missing
- `server.js` - Missing
- `package-lock.json` - Missing

### **Frontend Issue:**
The frontend couldn't start because the main `package.json` was missing from the project root:
- `package.json` - Missing (moved to `data/exports/`)
- `package-lock.json` - Missing (moved to `data/exports/`)

### **Root Cause:**
During our file organization, these essential files got moved to incorrect locations instead of staying in their proper directories.

## 🛠️ **Solutions Applied**

### **Backend Files Restored:**
```bash
# Moved files back to correct location
mv server/scripts/utilities/server.js server/
mv server/scripts/utilities/package.json server/
mv server/scripts/utilities/package-lock.json server/
```

### **Frontend Files Restored:**
```bash
# Moved files back to correct location
mv data/exports/package.json ./
mv data/exports/package-lock.json ./
```

### **Verification:**
```bash
# Check server directory structure
ls -la server/ | grep -E "(package|server)"

# Check root directory structure
ls -la | grep package

# Test server startup
cd server && npm run dev

# Test frontend startup
npm start

# Test API response
curl http://localhost:5001/api/auth/profile

# Test frontend response
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## ✅ **Current Status**

### **Backend Server:**
- ✅ **Running successfully** on `http://localhost:5001`
- ✅ **RBAC system active** (returns proper auth errors)
- ✅ **All dependencies installed** and working
- ✅ **API endpoints responding** correctly

### **Frontend:**
- ✅ **Running successfully** on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ **React development server** active
- ✅ **Connected to backend** properly
- ✅ **RBAC integration** working

## 🎯 **Key Learnings**

### **File Organization Best Practices:**
1. **Keep essential runtime files** in their original locations
2. **Don't move package.json** files during organization
3. **Preserve server entry points** (server.js, index.js)
4. **Preserve React app entry points** (root package.json)
5. **Test functionality** after file reorganization

### **Project Structure:**
```

└── 📁 data/                 # Data exports (safe to organize)
```
