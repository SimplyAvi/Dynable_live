          <p>We believe everyone deserves access to safe, delicious food — no matter their dietary restrictions. Dynable exists to eliminate the guesswork, fear, and frustration that come with food allergies by providing a smarter, personalized platform that connects people to recipes, products, and solutions they can trust.</p>

          <h2>Why We Started Dynable</h2>
          <p>Millions of people live with food allergies — and yet most food delivery, grocery, and recipe sites overlook their needs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A parent scrambling to find safe snacks after your child’s first allergic reaction…</li>
            <li>An adult just diagnosed with celiac, dairy, or black pepper allergy and unsure where to start…</li>
            <li>Someone who feels frustrated and restricted by your new food limitations…</li>
          </ul>
          <div className="aboutus-subsection" style={{margin: '32px 0', maxWidth: '100%'}}>
            <h3><strong>You’re not alone.</strong></h3>
            <p>At Dynable, we’ve met people who:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ate only five meals on repeat because they didn’t know what else was safe.</li>
              <li>Had to memorize every label and still ended up sick after cross-contamination.</li>
              <li>Stopped going out to eat entirely due to fear of hidden allergens.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We're building this platform for them — and for you.</p>

              <h4>Step 1: What are you allergic to?</h4>
              <p>That’s the first thing we ask. Because before we suggest a single product, recipe, or grocery item, we want to know what you need to avoid.</p>
              <p>You’ll see options like <strong>milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish,</strong> and <strong>sesame</strong> — the most common allergens — but you can add many others as well.</p>
              <p>These are the big ones — the Top 9 allergens responsible for the majority of serious reactions.</p>
              <p>But we go far beyond that.<br /> Maybe you’re allergic to mustard, corn, celery, or even something unexpected like black pepper. Dynable allows you to add those too — because we know that “less common” doesn’t mean “less dangerous.”</p>
              <p>Once you’ve told us what to watch out for, we filter everything on the site automatically. You don’t have to scan ingredient lists, decode labels, or worry about hidden triggers. We’ve got your back.</p>

                <li><strong>Safe substitutions</strong> in recipes where an ingredient you’re avoiding is normally used.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And we don’t limit you to a narrow selection — if you want to search for Thai food, baked goods, or protein-packed breakfasts, go for it. Dynable adapts your results behind the scenes so the experience always feels normal — just safer.</p>
