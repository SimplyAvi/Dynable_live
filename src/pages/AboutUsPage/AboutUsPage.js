        <p>That's the first thing we ask. Because before we suggest a single product, recipe, or grocery item, we want to know what you need to avoid.</p>
        <p>You'll see options like <strong>milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish,</strong> and <strong>sesame</strong> ‚Äî the most common allergens ‚Äî but you can add many others as well.</p>
        <p>These are the big ones ‚Äî the Top 9 allergens responsible for the majority of serious reactions.</p>
        <p>But we go far beyond that.<br /> Maybe you're allergic to mustard, corn, celery, or even something unexpected like black pepper. Dynable allows you to add those too ‚Äî because we know that "less common" doesn't mean "less dangerous."</p>
        <p>Once you've told us what to watch out for, we filter everything on the site automatically. You don't have to scan ingredient lists, decode labels, or worry about hidden triggers. We've got your back.</p>
